# jQuery Methods

In this lab, you'll be practicing using jQuery methods to manipulate HTML elements in the DOM. 

### Get To Work

You'll be coding your solution in `js/methods.js` underneath the comments. You'll want to have `index.html` open in the browser to test your work. After you make a change in `js/methods.js`, save your changes and refresh the browser.

Your task is to select each button from the `index.html` page that is labeled with an ID number for example `#b1` and use the click event method to write the code necessary to trigger the paragraph (in `index.html`) below the button to behave as the button is labeled for example `#b1` should `.hide()` paragraph 1 `#p1`. The first example is filled in. Repeat this for all remaining buttons and targeted elements. As a reference you can see a live code example [here](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/fe-jquery-exploring-methods/).
